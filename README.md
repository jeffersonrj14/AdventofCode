<div style="font-size:20px">
C was my first language when I learned how to code, and JavaScript still feels new inside my head. Will do my best to solve it in JavaScript.<br><br>
My challenge:
<ul>
    <li>Try solving it using C or Javascript</li>
    <li>Understand the question and search for a cheatsheet or resources if needed.</li>
    <li>Don't overthink a question.</li>
    <li>Never give up, and always have a good night's sleep.</li>
    <li>Continue learning the ZeroToMastery course. <strong>Don't stop learning</strong></li>
</ol>
</div>

### Note: Sorry, for being busy as I am currently more focused on finishing my course first.
